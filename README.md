Zootopia content
It is about a futuristic Zoo, in which users' avatars can admire animals in an educative manner (English learning purpose). If a user can type correctly the name of an animal, he/she can watch the firework spectacle, also some detailed information about that animal is also provided as an auto-response from AI-engine. 
A demonstrative video is available here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o_QncshPoZMFtA4Wr3QqGLQurkVPDKvg/view?usp=sharing
The content is also uploaded to our self-hosted catalyst: https://play.decentraland.org/?CATALYST=emg-dcl01.emg.edu.vn&position=-12%2C113&realm=emgverse&island=I1o
The Content is built specially for DCL Game Jam Event. Only the 3D Building is reused from our ongoing project for our own teaching activity on DCL.
